I have a diverse skill set in technology, programming, and innovative thinking. I am proficient in Python programming and completed a 30-hour training program with a certification from ICITB. I am also familiar with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have experience in other languages like Kotlin, Java, and GD Script. I enjoy game development and have created a few games using the Godot Engine, which are available on platforms like Itch.io.

My technical expertise extends to ethical hacking and cybersecurity, where I have learned various techniques, including MITM, WPA/WPA2 cracking, packet sniffing, and more, using tools such as Wireshark, Nmap, and Kali Linux. I am also exploring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, working with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch to delve into deep learning, NLP, and predictive modeling.

I have experience in app development, having designed and developed a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Flutterflow. Iâ€™ve been involved in various projects, such as creating games and participating in the science fair at my school, where I secured a 2nd runners-up position in the "Renewable Energy" category by demonstrating a practical prototype.

My academic foundation includes education at international schools in Papua New Guinea before continuing at Lyceum. I have earned awards like the bronze and silver in UNICEFâ€™s Mathletics competition. With a balanced profile of technical, academic, and creative pursuits, I aim to leverage my skills for future endeavors in technology and entrepreneurship.

I am passionate about technology and community service. Iâ€™m leading a Maths Club fundraiser with a goal of raising Rs. 50,000 through a movie screening, ticket sales, and raffles. Iâ€™ve created a desktop app called CashFlowCompanion (CFC), which uses AI to help users manage their finances. Iâ€™m exploring mobile app development with Flutterflow and diving into Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity, aiming to become the worldâ€™s youngest Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH). My dreams include launching several companies: Krate for flying cars, Etron for phones and laptops, Nature1st for using technology to protect the environment, and Galaxy, a space exploration venture similar to SpaceX. Balancing my technical interests, I enjoy Math, Commerce, Programming, chess, and basketball.
